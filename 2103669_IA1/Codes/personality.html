    <h2>My Strongest Trait</h2>
    <p>According to the SimilarMinds personality test, one of my strongest traits is <strong>Easygoing (70%)</strong>. This trait helps me stay calm and focused, especially during stressful school periods. Instead of panicking, I approach deadlines and assignments with a clear head, allowing me to stay on track and support my classmates when they need help too.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>The test results were surprisingly accurate. I related most to the Easygoing and Materialistic traits. While I enjoy aesthetic things, I mostly focus on staying grounded, balanced, and helping others around me â€” especially during group work or class discussions. I think this personality style makes me an empathetic teammate and a reliable student.</p>

    <h2>My Hero & Quote</h2>
    <p><strong>My Hero:</strong> My mom. She is the strongest person I know â€” loving, wise, and always supportive no matter what Iâ€™m going through.</p>
    <blockquote>"It might be long but it won't be forever." â€“ My Mom ðŸŒ¸</blockquote>
    <p>I chose her because she has taught me strength through softness. Her love and determination are the biggest influences on how I approach life and school with compassion and perseverance.</p>
