    <h3>Reflection on Chapters 4 – 7 of <em>Twelve Pillars</em> by Jim Rohn & Chris Widener</h3>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Summary & Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Reading chapters 4 through 7 of <em>Twelve Pillars</em> really gave me a new perspective. These chapters talk about things like staying disciplined, building your character, and having a clear vision of where you want to go in life. What stuck with me the most was how much our everyday choices can shape where we end up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a student working toward a degree in Computer Information Systems, I run into things all the time that test my focus and motivation. These chapters reminded me that success isn’t about one big moment, but about showing up and putting in the work a little at a time. It made me want to stay more on top of things, not just in school but also in how I take care of myself and treat others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also really connected with the idea of being honest and consistent in everything I do. Especially in tech, where people need to trust you, that message hit home. I'm going to keep working on setting clear goals, checking in on how I'm doing, and holding myself accountable.
